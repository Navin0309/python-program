# Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
# For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 9 8 9
# The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+917. Their absolute difference is 15-17 2.
# Function description
# Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.
# diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
# Int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
# Return
# Int: the absolute diagonal difference
# Input Format
# The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr. Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i], and consists of n space-separated Integers arr[i][j].
# Constraints
# â€¢-100 arr[i][j] < 100
# Output Format
# Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

# Sample Input
# 3
# 11 2 4
# 4 5 6
# 10 8 -12
# Sample Output
# 15
# Explanation
# The primary diagonal is:
# 11
# 5
# -12
# Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5-12 = 4
# The secondary diagonal is:
# 4
# 5
# 10
# Difference: 14-19 = 15
# Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4+5+10 = 19

a = int(input())
n = []

for i in range(a):
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n.append(b)

# q = sum([n[0][0], n[1][1], n[2][2]])
# k = sum([n[2][0], n[1][1], n[0][2]])
# print(abs(q-k))

k = sum([n[j][j] for j in range(len(n))])
q = sum([n[k][a-1-k]for k in range(len(n))])

print(abs(k-q))
